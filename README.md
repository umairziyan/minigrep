Potential updates

1. **Case Insensitivity (ADDED):** Add an option to perform case-insensitive searches. You could use a command-line argument to toggle this feature.

2. **Regex Support:** Integrate regular expressions to allow for more complex search patterns. You could use the `regex` crate for this.

3. **Line Number Display:** Modify the output to show line numbers along with the matching lines. This is useful for debugging or understanding the context of the match.

4. **Search in Multiple Files:** Expand the functionality to search across multiple files or directories, rather than just a single file.

5. **File Type Filtering:** Add a feature to filter files by type (e.g., only search in `.txt` files).

6. **Highlight Matches:** Implement a way to highlight or emphasize matching text in the output to make it easier to spot.

7. **Support for Binary Files:** Add an option to handle binary files or to skip them entirely during the search.

8. **Performance Improvements:** Optimize the search algorithm or implement parallel processing to handle large files or directories more efficiently.

9. **Interactive Mode:** Create an interactive mode where users can input search queries and navigate through results more dynamically.

10. **Customizable Output Formatting:** Allow users to customize the format of the output, such as showing matches in a specific color or format.
